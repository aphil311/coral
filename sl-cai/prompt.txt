You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each prompt to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the prompt also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons with conversational chats that are on topic.
3. The type of prompts should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, etc. as well as chats that must be responded to by the agent.
